- when all other players are all in, no need to ask the player left on what to do, it wil be automatically check

- player with 0 chips should not be dealt a hand
	- player with 0 chips should not be counted as player to be awaited a decision

- victory should be when no one else has chips
	- maybe iterate through all players?

- invalid raise (when bet <= pot)

- action animations

- delay in changePhase

- kicker

- A2 won against AK???
	- need to show what the players have on showdown

- a fallback action if AI responded wrongly (i.e. checked when it's not in the optiions)
	- need to ask the AI again for events like this

- maybe dl the pictures so we can avoid preloading

- handle gemini errors or input errors from gemini
	- when gemini has errored, try to send the same question again
- indicate big blind bets

low prio:
- chopped pot
- kickers for showdown

showdown error;
Q 9 9 A 4    ai:3 3      me:8 9

to do:
- showdown
- start new hand button
- board cards
- big blind bet
- on controllers, check for illegal moves
	- better if we disable illegal buttons, should be easy i think
- control buttons, should trigger for curPlayer
- on AI history, add the pre-flop stacks of all players
- prove the AI's decision is logical by adding a EXPL: object on its response
	- so we will have to make the AI respond in json
- the api key is in github. you will have to disable it.

1. looking for free apis and making them work
	- found that gemini works
2. tested a sample conversation, see if the AI will respond the way i want to
3. planning scripts and testing the flow on console log
	- created a seperate script for handling api communication, 
	called it api-handler.js
	- made it as a global variable so it's accessible to any scripts

	- created a gameControl to handle the state of the game

	- while creating the flow, checking on console log if it's correct
	- once flow is done, playing first in console log to check

4. planning the backend
	- creating dom scripts

5. preparing the ai integration
	- adding an handHistory to 

6. proven ai works, creating the control scripts

7. making the frontend
	- looking for card api so i wont have to download 52 cards
